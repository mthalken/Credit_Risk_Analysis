# Credit Risk Analysis

## The purpose of this analysis was to use sampling algorithms and machine learning models to reduce bias and predict credit risk to help a Credit Card Lending company provide a more reliable loan experience and more accurate identification for loan candidates. 

## Project Overview:
1. Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
2. Use the SMOTEEN algorithm to predict credit risk
3. Use ensemble classifiers to predict credit risk

## Resources
- Source of data: [LoanStats_2019Q1.csv](https://github.com/mthalken/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/resources/LoanStats_2019Q1.csv)
- Software: imbalanced-learn, skikit-learn, Python 3.7.10, Conda 4.10.3, Jupyter Notebook 6.3.0, Visual Studio Code 1.60.2
